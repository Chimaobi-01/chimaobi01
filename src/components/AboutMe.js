            Hi there, i'm chimaobi. .
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't really tell when i got interested with computing but My first experience with programming was
            in my second year in the University in 2016 Then i was a big fan of java programming but things changed.
            I wondered into web development more.
        </p>
        <p>
            When i started out learning the basics of web programming as well as careers in software development, i knew from start 
            i was going to settle for frontend development because then in my school dats, i was a very "good artist" and my mates would 
            cluster me when there's a skeleton, or amoeba or even an animal cell to draw. (an amoeba don't relly have a form/shape)
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey in programming has not really been a smooth ride, i mean there were lots of stops and u-turns made a some point
            but you fate (search for a better life) kept bringing me back to it. So far, i have involved myself in several free bootcamps and has 
            used lots of free resources online which has impacted me in one way or the other, but yes. I'm a self taught developer in general.
        </p>
        <p>Notable ones are HNG ZURI Internship, ALX and more. Interesting fact, i didn't make it to the finalist for all these oline programs mentioned</p>
